When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I wanted to collaborate with other developers to develop open source software, to have a portfolio of my work, or to have cloud backup of projects in a Git repository, rather than using a solution like DropBox.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Having more control over version-control is part of the purpose of Git.  You may not want to share a commit on GitHub, because it isn't working, or you may have thousands of local commits that would be too much detail to push.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is a clone of someone else's project on GitHub that points back to their original project.  A clone is a copy of another project.  A branch is a split from the master branch, and doesn't effect changes on other branches unless they are merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
